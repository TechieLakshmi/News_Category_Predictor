# News_Category_Predictor

* Created a basic Flask based News Categorization Web App. Utilized Randomforest, MultinomialNB & Logistic regression for news categorization. 
* Used TF-IDF to transform text to vector.
* In production level, we can use docker containerization for microservice architecture, scalability as we can replace the csv files with a database (MondoDb,Postgres etc..),casandra, SAP,Oracle,Salesforce etc.
* pip install -r requirements.txt before you run for library dependencies.
* Run the app using the code 'Python main.py'
